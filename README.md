# Continusously Informed Heuristic A* - Optimal path retrieval inside an unknown environment #

This project deals with the problem of retrieving the optimal path between two points inside an unknown environment, utilizing a robot-scouter.

In principle, the optimal path can be guaranteed by a searching agent that adopts an A*-like decision mechanism. The proposed CIA* inherits the A* optimality and efficiency guarantees, while at the same time exploits the learnt formation of the obstacles, to on-line revise the heuristic evaluation of the candidate states.
